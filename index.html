        <h2>Understanding ADU Construction</h2>
        <p>ADU construction involves the design and building of a separate, fully functional living space on the same property as an existing home. These units can be attached to the main house, detached as a stand-alone structure, or converted from existing spaces like garages or basements. ADUs typically include a kitchen, bathroom, sleeping area, and living space, making them suitable for long-term living.</p>

    <div class="container section">
        <h2>The Growing Popularity of ADU Construction</h2>
        <p>The surge in popularity of ADUs can be attributed to several factors. Rising housing costs, urban density, and the need for flexible living spaces have made ADUs an attractive option. Additionally, many local governments, including in Roseville, are easing zoning laws and offering ADU permit assistance</b> to encourage development. These changes have made it easier and more affordable for homeowners to add ADUs to their properties.</p>
